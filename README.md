# Brain-Tumor-Classification
This project implements a deep learning–based brain tumor classification system using an enhanced UNet architecture with CBAM. The model analyzes MRI scans and classifies them into Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor, improving diagnostic accuracy through attention-based feature learning.
